/// Drives the interaction between a stream of items and a service which processes them

/// `Driver`, as a high-level, facilitates taking items from an arbitrary `Stream` and pushing them
/// through a `Service`, spawning each call to the service so that work can be run concurrently,
/// managing waiting for the service to be ready before processing more items, and so on.
///
/// Additionally, `Driver` handles two event-specific facilities: finalization and acknowledgement.
///
/// This capability is parameterized so any implementation which can define how to interpret the
/// response for each request, as well as define how many events a request is compromised of, can be
/// used with `Driver`.
